# An Alternative Introduction to Radio Interferometry

As some of you may know, I’m currently a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology studying towards my Master of Science in Electrical Engineering. While I’m here, I’m working with Gregg Hallinan and Sandy Weinreb – two phenomenal instructors on a project called the Long Wavelength Array (LWA). The LWA is a 256-element interferometer in Owens Valley, CA which take radio images of the entire sky every 10 seconds. This project is particularly exciting for me because I’ve always been interested in how many distinct dishes can synthesize coherent images, sometimes with resolutions that cannot be achieved with single dish telescopes!

	Radio interferometry, often times comes off as a difficult concept, but it needn’t be that way. In this blog post, I will attempt to give a more intuitive introduction to radio interferometry. Some background in the Fourier transform will be helpful, but not strictly necessary. I will also assume some basic knowledge of astronomy. 
	
I will start with the big punchline of radio interferometry and then work backwards to then justify everything else. So, are you ready for it? The big reveal? Ok, here it is: the most mind-blowing fact about radio astronomy (or optical astronomy for that matter) is that instead of directly observing the sky, radio interferometers measure the Fourier transform of the sky. Slow down, don’t leave just yet, let’s take a minute to break this down. The Fourier transform is a method of taking data which is represented in one way (i.e. a series of measurements over time, or a series of pixels across a spatial grid) and representing it in a different, but equally-valid way. When you take the Fourier transform of some data, no information is lost, the data has simply been rearranged. Simultaneously, there exists a method by which we can take some data which has been Fourier transformed and undo the Fourier transform to recover the original data. This procedure is called the inverse Fourier transform. The important thing to take away from this, is that if we measure the Fourier transform of the sky, then we can reconstruct an image of the sky brightness by taking the inverse Fourier transform of that data. But enough words, let’s look at some pictures.
